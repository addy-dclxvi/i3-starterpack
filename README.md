## Update August 2024

I put some changes to my i3 setup.

- I change the colorscheme
- I change the statusbar
- I cleanup the window rules
- I change some keybinds
- I change the fonts (included in the repo)
- I change the default apps
- And others. Please read the config before use.

I also made a light theme and put it in [this](https://github.com/addy-dclxvi/i3-starterpack/tree/update-24.08) branch.
